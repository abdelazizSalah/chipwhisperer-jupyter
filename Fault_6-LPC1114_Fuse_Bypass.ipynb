    "## Background on Code Read Protection\n",
    "\n",
    "To help protect proprietary code from being dumped via a bootloader or a debugging interface, many microcontrollers include some mechanism that locks down the flash and prevents reads. In the case of NXP's LPC1114, this is done by reading a value from flash during the boot sequence, with different values corresponding to different levels of protection. As is shown in the figure below, there are 4 levels of read protection, with the rest of the values representing an unlocked device. This makes this a great target for glitching, as corrupting one bit from this read will unlock the device and give us full access. Since higher CRP levels are harder (or in the case of CRP level 3, \"impossible\") to remove, we'll be using the device in CRP level 1.\n",

    "\n",
    "This tutorial requires some hardware setup. We will use a \"LPC-P1114\" development board, available from Mouser or Digikey.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ChipWhisperer-Lite (CW1173) with LPC-P1114 Development Board\n",
    "\n",
    "To allow the ChipWhisperer-Lite to interface with this board, we'll need to make some small modifications to the board:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Short jumper BLD_E to put the device in bootloader mode.\n",
    "2. Solder a wire from GND to P0_3 (Second column from the left, fourth row from the bottom) to put the bootloader in UART mode.\n",
    "3. Remove C1 and C4 from the board.\n",
    "4. Cut the traces on 3.3V_CORE and 3.3V_IO_E.\n",
    "5. Add a 12-ohm resistor on the 3.3V_CORE jumper.\n",
    "6. Add an SMA connector to the board and connect Vcc to the center pin and GND to one of the outside pins (or just use a jumper instead of fancy SMA).\n",
    "7. Add a header pin/wire to RST (First column from the left, third row from the bottom). The CW-Lite needs two connection points, as we'll be both resetting this pin and triggering off of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following shows the required modifications:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image show LPC-P1114 Modifications](img\\A9_LPC1114_CHANGES.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we'll need to connect the CW-Lite to the connect pins on the dev board to pins on CW-Lite's 20 pin header:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Connect pin 1 of UEXT (Vcc) to pin 3 on the CW-Lite\n",
    "2. Connect pin 2 of UEXT (GND) to pin 2 on the CW-Lite\n",
    "3. Connect pin 3 of UEXT (TXD) to pin 10 on the CW-Lite\n",
    "4. Connect pin 4 of UEXT (RXD) to pin 12 on the CW-Lite\n",
    "5. Connect RST (the 3 header pins soldered on) to pins 5 (nRST) and 16 (GPIO4) on the CW-Lite\n",
    "7. Finally, attach an SMA cable between the one you added to the board and the GLITCH connector on the CW-Lite. If you'd like instead you can also use a SMA Tee to do both measurement & glitch.\n",
