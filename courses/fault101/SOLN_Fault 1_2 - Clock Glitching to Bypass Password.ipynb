    "We've already seen how we can insert clock gliches to mess up a calculation that a target is trying to make. While this has many applications, some which will be covered in Fault_201, let's take a look at something a little closer to our original example of glitch vulnerable code: a password check. No need to change out firmware here, we're still using the simpleserial-glitch project (though we'll go through all the build stuff again).\n",
    "\n",
    "The code is as follows for the password check:\n",
    "\n",
    "```C\n",
    "uint8_t password(uint8_t* pw)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    char passwd[] = \"touch\";\n",
    "    char passok = 1;\n",
    "    int cnt;\n",
    "\n",
    "    trigger_high();\n",
    "\n",
    "    //Simple test - doesn't check for too-long password!\n",
    "    for(cnt = 0; cnt < 5; cnt++){\n",
    "        if (pw[cnt] != passwd[cnt]){\n",
    "            passok = 0;\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "    trigger_low();\n",

    "    simpleserial_put('r', 1, (uint8_t*)&passok);\n",
