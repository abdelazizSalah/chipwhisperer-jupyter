    "With how many traces we're capturing, analyzing our traces will take a lot of time with ChipWhisperer - Analyzer wasn't designed for performance. It is for this reason that we will be using LASCAR, an open source side channel analysis library with a bigger emphasis on speed than ChipWhisperer Analyzer. Normally, it would take a bit of work to massage ChipWhisperer into the LASCAR format; however, ChipWhisperer has recently integrated some basic LASCAR support, making it easy to combine LASCAR and ChipWhisperer projects!

    "\n",
    "Thus far, we've been exclusively focusing on software AES. Here, each AES operation (shift rows, add round key, mix columns, etc) is implemented using one basic operation (XOR, reads/writes, multiplies, etc.) per clock cycle. With a hardware implementation, it's often possible to not only combine basic operations into a block that can run in a single clock cycle, but also combine multiple AES operations and run them in a single block! For example, the CW305 FPGA board can run each round of AES in a single clock cycle!\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this, running a CPA attack on hardware AES is much trickier than on software AES. In software, we found that it was easy to search for the outputs of the s-boxes because these values would need to be loaded from memory onto a high-capacitance data bus. This is not necessarily true for hardware AES, where the output of the s-boxes may be directly fed into the next stage of the algorithm. In general, we may need some more knowledge of the hardware implementation to successfully complete an attack. That being said, if we take a look at a block diagram of AES:\n",

Our reset assumption that allowed us to simply use the Hamming weight instead of the Hamming distance also probably won't be valid here. As such, let's use the Hamming distance between the output and the input of the last round.\n",
