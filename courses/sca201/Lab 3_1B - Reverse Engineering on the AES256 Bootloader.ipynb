We've done a bit of sniffing on the serial lines when the device's firmware is being updated and we've learned the following:\n",

    "* The device communicates over serial at 38400 baud\n",
    "* When writing memory, the first byte is always zero (probably a command byte)\n",
    "* There's a 16 byte block of random looking memory (aka it doesn't look like firmware). This part is probably encrypted\n",
    "* There's a 4 byte CRC at the end of each message\n",
    "* There's no repetition in the ciphertext.\n",

This looks a lot like AES - we can see a long distinct operation that's probably MixColumns in there and the overall structure looks a lot like what we saw when looking at TINYAES128C encryptions. Let's make a weak assumption that this is AES128 - we can adjust this as we learn more about the bootloader.\n",

We can still attack AES256 without much issue: we basically just have to run two CPA attacks, one for the first half of the key and another for the second half. Again, we're not 100% about this, but it's a good starting point. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we mentioned in the debriefing about the bootloader, the ciphertext never seems to repeat. It's pretty unlikely that this device is using straight AES256 (if it even is using AES256), since firmware usually has blocks that repeat. More likely is that AES is being used as a stream cipher: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation. This could pose an immediate problem for our attack efforts: we need to know either what's going into or coming out of the AES block to perform a CPA attack. However, some of the modes listed on that page (if it's even using one on that page) feed an IV or a counter into that block instead of the plaintext or the ciphertext. We didn't see any encryption operations happening on startup (which the device could've done if it was using one of these IV/counter modes), so we'll probably be okay with a normal CPA attack.

    "\n",
    "This is enough information for us to attack a single bit of the IV. Suppose we only wanted to get the first bit (bit 0) of the first byte (byte 0) of the IV. We could do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Split all of the traces into two groups: those with `(DR[0] & 0x01) = 0`, and those with `(DR[0] & 0x01) = 1`. \n",

    "* Find the difference between the two averages. Provided we've got sufficient data, we should see a spike where the xor is occuring.\n",
    "* Look at the direction of the spike to decide if the IV bit is 0 `(PT[0] = DR[0])` or if the IV bit is 1 `(PT[0] = ~DR[0])`.\n",

    "This is effectively a DPA attack on a single bit of the IV. We can repeat this attack across the whole IV by instead separating by `(DR[byte] & (1 << bit) = 0` and `(DR[byte] & (1 << bit) = bit`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll need to reset the device every encryption since it only uses the IV in the first encryption. This leads to a slightly modified capture loop. You'll need to adjust your offset since we're now triggering near the beginning of the UART transmit instead of nera the end. Run the loop, then interrupt it to get a wave. Then plot and adjust your offset. Repeat until you're near the end of the encryption again:"
